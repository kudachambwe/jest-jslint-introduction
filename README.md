# Introduction to Static and Dynamic testing using JS
> This is a simple example for how to do static testing (JSLint) and perfoming
dynamic testing with the help of Jest.

## Why JS?
- [x] **Rapid growth of popularity** during recent years (among job recruiters)
- [x] More and more projects (GitHub) are written in javascript
- [x] **Huge ecosystem** of libaries and frameworks (ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS etc)
- [x] **Easy and quick** to learn (slow learning curve)

## Why JSLint?
- [x] Improves **code quality**
- [x] **Minimizes bug-proned code**
- [x] (-) Can be unnecessary and annoying (e.g. on harmless features)..


## Why Jest?

- [x] **Free and very easy** to setup
- [x] Lets you generate and watch **test results**
- [x] Generates **code coverage** reports
- [x] Built and used by Facebook
- [X] Used by other heavy supporters (e.g. Spotify, Instagram, Paypal, Reddit, Twitter, Oculus, Pinterest etc.)
